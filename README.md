This C++ project contains the functionality, code, and methods necessary for a game with mystical characters to interact with each other and funciton. 
There are three main classes for players to choose from: dragons, ghouls, or mindflayers. Each character has their own moves and special attributes.
The player will encounter these creatures and can choose to add them to their caverns. 
The caverns are like a type of inventory, where each character addition has its own hitpoints, stats, and attacks.
This project simply laids the grounds work for a bigger project to use it as the blueprint, creating something like a DND game or pokemon-like game.
